# Ansible Notes

This is a Repo to store all of my notes and experiences with Ansible. The idea is to record information on here, with weblinks, general info for myself when I forget and maybe for other people starting out with their Ansible journey

# Apps

This will be used to store information about Apps, including Configs, helpful starting guides and those little difference between say Debian and RHEL

# Modules

I will use this to create a page per Module that I use and list any useful web post or video that I use
